# Vina Raja – CS601 Term Project

This is my personal portfolio website for MET CS601.  
It showcases my background, interests, resume, gallery, skills learned, and a contact form.

## Structure

- `site/` – main HTML/CSS/JavaScript/TypeScript portfolio site
- `react-widget/` – small React widget (separate mini app) linked from the Skills page

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox and Grid for layout)
- JavaScript (DOM manipulation and form validation)
- TypeScript (compiled to JavaScript for a skills widget)
- React (separate mini widget app)

## How to View

Open `site/index.html` in a browser.  
For the React widget, open the `react-widget` folder and follow its own README instructions.
